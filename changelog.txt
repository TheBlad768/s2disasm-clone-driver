  CHANGELOG
-------------

05-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* The major change is that many IDs have been replaced with constants ("equates") to make them dynamic.
  To do this, it was necessary to add labels in many tables. Some names may be inaccurate,
  so please change them if needed. A new macro, "id" computes the value of these dynamic IDs using 1 parameter
  and 3 global variables, which are changed before each set of IDs. Note that the sound driver also has
  dynamic IDs (which was necessary to get the music IDs working).
* Some other data structures have been improved to allow the use of these new dynamic IDs.
  Some labels were changed to reflect the new size of the next DC directive.
* Constants for zone and act IDs were also added, but they can't easily be made dynamic
  because they're used in several tables.
* Constants for controller buttons were also added.
* I added a macro in the end of level results screen object to make editing the data easier.
  The parameter names also serve to document the structure.
* Some labels incorrectly had PortA_OK or PortC_OK in their names, probably because someone did a
  global search and replace on the old label names (which were left as comments). I renamed those
  labels back to their original name (starting with loc_214 and loc_292 respectively).
  PortA_OK and PortC_OK themselves are left untouched.
* Somewhere, 2 base-10 arrays were left as hex values. The first one, a table of words, was changed to a
  table of longs in decimal (see word_8732, now dword_8732). The second one, word_1F6D2, keeps word-sized values,
  but now has them in decimal.
* An "align 2" directive was added after some BINCLUDE'd data.
* Added a comment before the part that tries to play the "continue" jingle when the 14 continues cheat is entered
  to tell how to fix the bug that makes the OOZ music play until reset.
* There may be some other minor changes I missed, but if I made them, it's because I believe they're worth it!

05-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Fixed an equate error causing a one byte error in the ROM
* Added and renamed some RAM equates: Water_move is now Water_fullscreen_flag, and Delay_Time
  has been renamed to Vint_routine
* Renamed DelayProgram to WaitForVint for accuracy purposes, and renamed a bunch of scrolling and
  foreground drawing routines
* Commented scrolling code and parts of foreground drawing code
* Added vdpComm function (although code needs to be modified to make use of it)
* Added chkbitperfect.bat and s2rev01.bin

06-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Added some old labels in comment form for ease of searching (I'd forgotten last time)
* Commented Enigma compression routine and fixed its function header
* Changed align 2 directive to even for consistency with the rest of the disasm
* Converted jmp xxx.l instructions to jmp (xxx).l form - nitpicky, but meh
* Converted jsr xxx and jmp xxx instructions to use (xxx).l addressing. This prevents the commonly
  encountered "addressing mode not allowed here" errors caused by size optimization attempts
* Modified build.bat to output errors to file, though this can be turned off by running it as build -pe.
  Also added support for this parameter to chkbitperfect.bat, and made it check for the existence
  of s2built.bin before running the binary comparison

06-Oct-2008 - qiuu:
* Added some RAM address equates
* Renamed some labels, primarily layer deformation and level select related
* Commented EHZ Boss code
* Some commenting on collision and level select routines

06-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Renamed all ShowVDPGraphicsX routines to PlaneMapToVRAMX routines for accuracy purposes
* Converted quite a few VDP commands to use the vdpComm function. There are a lot more left, I'll
  come to those later
* Added chkbitperfect.bat and s2rev01.bin

07-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* Changed build.bat to show a message if there were errors/warnings.
* Removed the redundant size parameter in the palptr macro. The new palette macro declares the 2 necessary
  labels to make this feature work.
* Replaced some hard-coded loop iteration counts with expressions using labels. Added the necessary labels.
* Replaced the values in TailsNameCheat_Buttons with the button constants. Added comments about the 0 entry.

07-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Converted more VDP commands to use the vdpComm function
* In the process, commented and labelled some 2P level select functions, and simplified the data at
  LevSel2PIconData (formerly off_8F7E)
* Also simplified the data at OptScrBoxData (formerly off_92BA)

07-Oct-2008 - qiuu:
* A few more RAM address equates

07-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Added a link to the relevant wiki pages in the section headers of NemDec, KosDec and EniDec

* Split the constants (or "equates") from s2.asm. Define new constants, in particular constants RAM
  addresses, in s2.constants.asm from now on.

08-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Enhanced titleLetters macro to work with normal level titles
* Re-coded it again to use a bitfield instead of a string, dunno why I didn't think of that

* Gave other labels significant names (cycling palettes, palette altering routines, etc.)
* Added 3 RAM variables: Palette_fade_start, Palette_fade_length and Ending_demo_number
* Added a few macros to calculate the absolute value (see the comments in the code) and used them
* Added a constant to turn all optimizations on
* Reworked the palptr macro to take the palette line as an argument instead of an address

14-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* Made a "nosignpost" macro near SetLevelEndType

  Pointed out an oversight in Super Sonic's palette cycle code and explained how to fix it.
  Renamed Palette_frame_count to Palette_timer and added RAM equate Palette_frame.
* I worked on the teleport monitor code a bit:
  Renamed loc_12AA6 to teleport_monitor. The monitor contents are now all named.
  Renamed byte_12C52 to teleport_swap_table and restructured it to enhance readability.
  Replaced a constant ($11) to make the teleport_swap_table easier to extend.
  Replaced some labels with nameless temporary symbols

19-Oct-2008 - shobiz:
* Added a few more equates
* Commented all of the RingsManager routines, and split ring mappings to file
* Commented all of the BuildSprites routines

20-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* Replaced a lot of labels with nameless temporary symbols
  (if you think some places could have a good label, don't hesitate to replace the symbols)
* Added dynamic IDs for the 2 players VS mode results screens
* Added an equate for PSG input

23-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* Revamped the RAM variables section
* More nameless temporary symbols

* New labels for the 2P software scroll managers
* Other miscellaneous changes

25-Oct-2008 - MoDule:
* Commented most of the Monitor code.
* Named a bunch of labels and replaced some with nameless temporary symbols.
  I couldn't think of good names for loc_128C6, loc_128DE and sub_128E4.
* Added a few RAM equates for addresses that are used for the 2p results.
* Changed a few hex values to decimal in the super ring code.

27-Oct-2008 - FraGag:
* More nameless temporary symbols

* Added some *_End labels in the RAM constants
* Added an empty line after most DBcc instructions, and moved the empty line before the start of
  a loop above the initialization of the loop counter, if present
* Identified OilSlides_Chunks
* Made ObjC9's routine table an actual table (as I did with ObjCC)

04-Nov-2008 - qiuu:
* fully commented MCZ boss and AnimatieBoss routine
* added boss and subsprite related constants

04-Nov-2008 - shobiz:
* Identifed $FFFFE700
* Marked the start and end addresses for some unknown RAM regions
* Converted byte_118CE into proper offset table
* The major change is the addition and usage of the macros zoneOffsetTable, zoneTableEntry and
  zoneTableEnd. These macros automatically sort offset tables which use the zone ID as an offset, and thus
  enable easy re-arranging of zone IDs without having to worry about re-arranging dozens of offset tables as
  well. Additionally, whenever a new zone is added, the zoneTableEnd macro will automatically warn you about
  which offset tables you need to add more stuff to. I've tested out some swaps and everything seems to work
  properly, but I'd appreciate it if people could test different combinations out, and either fix any bugs
  encountered themselves or post about them for others to fix. It should be noted that useFullWaterTables should
  be set to 1 inside Assembly Options when you're shifting IDs around, and that s2p2bin will complain about
  overlapping allocations, but these warnings can be safely ignored.

08-Nov-2008 - FraGag:
* More nameless temporary symbols
* Added a space around the '-' operator in all offset tables
* Identified and labelled every animation script (some were not even disassembled properly)

* Identified some stuff in Obj1C

29-Nov-2008 - Malevolence:
* Completely commented the WFZ boss

01-Dec-2008 - FraGag:
* More nameless temporary symbols
* Added SST entries for Obj28 (animal)
* Identified Obj28_States
* Added a macro, obj28decl
* Replaced BCC instructions with BHS and BCS with BLO (after CMP/CMPI instructions only)
* Added a few comments in the points text code

20-Dec-2008 - FraGag:
* More nameless temporary symbols
* Changed some labels related to the rings objects
* Fully commented the CollectRing routine (formerly sub_11FC2)
* Replaced some instances of objoff_3F with parent+1 where applicable
* Labelled the unused big ring and ring flash objects
* Added SST entries for
  * ObjDC (casino ring prize) and ObjD3 (casino bomb prize)
  * ObjC9 (title screen palette changer)
  * Obj34 (title card)
* Added "id" as an SST entry, and edited insn1op and insn2op accordingly

01-Jan-2009 - MoDule:
* The objects manager is nearly fully commented. All that remains is the two player portion
* Nameless temporary symbols where appropriate
* Named some labels (most notably ObjectsManager, which was just loc_17AA4, before)
  (Most names are taken from a file given to me by shobiz)
* Determined the use of Obj_load_addr_0 and Obj_load_addr_1.
  Obj_load_addr_2 and Obj_load_addr_3 are probably the equivalents for player two.

23-Feb-2009 - FraGag:
* Fixed the Sonic and Tails palette, which caused problems on the title cards.

01-Mar-2009 - qiuu:
* labeled Boss specific collision and camera value initialisation routine and correspondent indices
* fixed misnomer with routines that set the background scrolling flags
* further minor labeling

30-Mar-2009 - FraGag:
* Removed the assembleZ80SoundDriver switch, because the disassembly doesn't build anymore if set to 0
* Moved the macro definitions and related constants to s2.macros.asm
* Renamed zoneOffsetTable to zoneOrderedTable
* Created the offsetTable, offsetTableEntry, zoneOffsetTableEntry macros and used them where appropriate
* Renamed the main routine tables of every object to ObjXX_Index
* Random relabelling here and there, particularly in objects
* Fixed the indices in the comments of some offset tables
* Removed the WrdArr_ prefix
* Reverted some nameless temporary symbols
* Named some SST entries for some objects
* Identified the animals data in Obj28
* Changed all the remaining score bonus literals to decimal notation
* Added an if/endif block around the checksum error code
* Created the subObjData macro and used it where sub-object data is declared
* Created the zoneanimstart and zoneanimend macros, and edited the zoneanimdecl macro, to compute the number of
  elements in a zone animation script list

07-Aug-2009 - MoDule:
* Ram Variables
  * identified $FFFFF78C  and $FFFFF7DC as Camera_X_pos_last_P2 and Camera_X_pos_coarse_P2, respectively
  * renamed Obj_load_addr_0 and Obj_load_addr_1 to Obj_load_addr_right and Obj_load_addr_left, respectively
* Redid object manager documentation
  * list of registers used
  * changed a few comments
  * same for ChkLoadObj
* Named SST entries related to subsprites and added an SST entry "next_subspr".
  I also added SST entries for subsprites 6 through 9 so people can see which entries they overlap with.
  Hope I got everything. I did a search for "#6,render_flags(a" to find any sprites that use subsprites.
  Some of the undocumented boss objects still use overlapping SST entres. I'll leave that to someone
  else for the time being. objoff_B and objoff_F are now unused. I'll leave them in for now in case I
  made a mistake somewhere.
* Other minor changes here and there

16-Mar-2010 - Xenowhirl:
* Fixed missing pointer in Sound39 (platform crumble) so it won't screw up if offset.

* Documented Sega screen a bit more.
* Added equates for several VRAM and art tile addresses, as well as macros.
* Added animation IDs.
* Documented collision routine a bit more, as well as adding equates for important bits.
* A bit of documentation for endgame and Tornado (ObjB2).
* Added names for a few variables and documented CNZ special bumpers.
